#1. Get a free Azure Subscription

In order to create a free Azure Subscription, you can either use

## 1a. Sign up for Visual Studio Dev Essentials.

You can find your machine in the **Virtual Machines** or **All Resources** sections of the Azure Portal.

Click the Virtual Machine, then click the **Connect** button. 

This will download a RDP (Remote Desktop Connection) file. Click **Open** to open the connection dialog.

Enter your username and password in the connection window. 

Once the connection has been established, you can run SQL Server Management Studio from within the VM itself,  and connect to your new SQL Server 2016 instance.
